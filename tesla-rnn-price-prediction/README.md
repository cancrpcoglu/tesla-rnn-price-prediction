# tesla-rnn-price-prediction
Tesla stock price prediction using RNN

1-) This project uses historical stock data of Tesla (TSLA) to predict future prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model

2-) About the Project
Dataset: TSLA.csv

3-) Goal: Predict future stock prices by learning temporal patterns in the data

Model Used: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

4-) Libraries Used
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-scikit-learn
-tensorflow / keras

5-) How to Run

  1-) Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tesla-rnn-stock-prediction.git
  cd tesla-lstm-stock-prediction

  2-) Install the required libraries:


  pip install -r requirements.txt
  3-) Open and run rnn_model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

6-)Notes
The dataset was normalized before training and inverse-transformed after prediction.

The model is trained on historical closing prices only.

Time-based train/test split was applied to preserve the sequence of the data.

This model is based on features in the TSLA.csv dataset, with labels for open values and close values used for 70% training and 30% validation. After training, the model predicts prices for the next three months.
